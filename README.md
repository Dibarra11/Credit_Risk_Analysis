# Credit_Risk_Analysis-

## Project Overview

The project is based using six different machine learning models to determine if a loan based on the data provided was considered high risk or low risk

## Results

1) Naive Random Oversampling

- Balanced Accuracy Score was 0.6438
- For high risk loans, the precision and recall was 0.01 and 0.69 respectively. For low risk loans, the precision and recall was 1.00 and 0.59 respectively.

2) SMOTE Oversampling

- Balanced Accuracy Score was 0.6628
- For high risk loans, the precision and recall was 0.01 and 0.63 respectively. For low risk loans, the precision and recall was 1.00 and 0.69 respectively.
